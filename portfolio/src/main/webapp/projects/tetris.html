              For each potential move we consider four heuristics: max-height, bumpiness, covered holes, and completed lines. Each
              move is assigned a score based on our agent's weights, and the column/orientation with the highest score is selected. Initially,
              we create a population of organisms with random weights, but each generation we select the best-performing ones to crossover,
              creating a new generation with better weights. In under 10 generations, we can create organisms that never lose.

              The Python version is a clone of Classic Tetris for the NES and runs using pygame. An alternative implementation in C
              displays visuals with ncurses and can be run without visualization at much greater speeds.
